  "generic_mission/diversion/description2": "As a rule, the destruction of infrastructure is not our priority, but in this case, sabotage is justified - by destroying a key object, we will make it more difficult for Daamat to control the region.",
  "generic_mission/diversion/description3": "Intelligence has provided all the necessary information so that we can sabotage the enemy's key facility. This will undoubtedly weaken him.",

  "passive_mission/theft/description1": "Intelligence has transmitted information about one enemy warehouse, which is practically unguarded. There is a chance to obtain valuable resources without a single shot.",

  "passive_mission/search/description1": "They say that there are mothballed army warehouses in the sector since time immemorial. It's worth sending people to search for them.",
  "passive_mission/search/description2": "We got a tip that a local oligarch, who fled away from the military action, managed to hide some valuables. There are approximate coordinates, so it's worth looking for the cache.",

  "mission_05/dial_10/02/julia": "Commander, the boys have had a real rough time. Maybe we should let them rest and send fresh forces from the reserve group to the fortress?",
  "mission_06/dial_01/comment/vyuga": "I don't like this. We'll be in the palm of your hand here.",
  "mission_06/dial_01/comment/grif": "And the ancient masters were quite knowledgeable about fortification... to our misfortune.",
  "mission_06/dial_01/comment/debut": "The most fortified place in the fortress is the donjon. Logically, we should go there.",
  "mission_06/dial_01/comment/shilo": "Wow, they've built something here! It's impressive!",
  "mission_06/dial_01/comment/simba": "Oh, if only we had artillery... We'd roll everything out here stone by stone!",
  "mission_06/dial_01/comment/shaman": "Beautiful. Old stones. They remember a lot.",
  "mission_06/dial_01/comment/chuma": "Cool place! I'd climb here in peacetime.",
  "mission_06/dial_01/comment/umka": "I don't see anyone. They've probably settled in and are waiting for us to go further away...",

  "mission_06/dial_01/comment/disel": "The place is good, you can defend yourself here for a long time...",
  "mission_06/dial_02/01/voice": "Teacher, you can't stay there! Without you, the whole movement will fall apart! I beg you, save yourself now!",
  "mission_06/dial_02/02/teacher": "Oh no, my friend. To show weakness in the face of the enemy is a defeat far greater than death. I must stay.",
  "mission_06/dial_02/03/teacher": "And if something happens to me... Well, Smart Guy knows what to do.",
  "mission_06/dial_02/04/militant": "They've broken through! They're already in the citadel!",
  "mission_06/dial_02/05/teacher": "So it's time to accept the fight...",
  "mission_06/dial_03/01/teacher": "The enemies decided that they could deal us a sneaky blow that we didn't expect.",
  "mission_06/dial_03/02/teacher": "They don't know that they have entered the lion's den - and will find only death here.",
  "mission_06/dial_03/03/teacher": "The truth is on our side. Daamat will win!",
  "mission_06/dial_03/comment/simba": "Right, yeah! Got a run for it!",
  "mission_06/dial_03/comment/grif": "I have some doubts about this.",

  "mission_06/dial_03/comment/disel": "Well, we'll see about that...",
  "mission_06/dial_03/comment/chapay": "Heh, the bug is small but stinky!",
  "mission_06/dial_03/comment/chuma": "Don't make me laugh, grandpa! You haven't seen us in action!",

  "mission_06/dial_04/01/teacher": "We must fight to the last drop of blood. For our future. For the memory of our ancestors.",
  "mission_06/dial_04/02/teacher": "And although I am too old to hold a weapon, too old to travel through towns and villages, even from here, from the citadel, I can clearly see everything that is happening in Africa.",

  "mission_06/dial_05/01/teacher": "All my life I believed in one idea. The idea of a great Africa.",

  "mission_06/dial_05/04/teacher": "I'm not afraid to die. And you shouldn't be afraid.",
  "mission_06/dial_05/05/julia": "I think I understand everything. We were wrong. We imagined the Teacher as a spider in the center of the web, pulling the strings and controlling everything…",
  "mission_06/dial_05/06/julia": "But he doesn't control anything! He's an orator, an ideologist. He started a fire - and now it's burning without any control... Well, or under control, but definitely not from the Teacher.",
  "mission_06/dial_05/07/julia": "The old man sits in his fortress, believes that a bright future is about to arrive - and preaches. That's all!",
  "mission_06/dial_05/08/julia": "Yes, he is the mastermind behind all these events, but he is not a monster, he is just... a fool.",
  "mission_06/dial_06/01/kanindo": "Bravo, my friend! We did it, you and I! We tore the snake's poisonous sting out of its mouth!",
  "mission_06/dial_06/02/kanindo": "Your guys have done their job, now we'll take care of the old man ourselves.",
  "mission_06/dial_06/03/kanindo": "Believe me, he will die a long, long time... In front of all those to whom he caused so much harm!",
  "mission_06/dial_07/01/teacher": "I appeal to you, commander of the aliens. I have lost and I admit my defeat.",
  "mission_06/dial_07/02/teacher": "I do not ask for mercy, I ask only one thing: let me die with dignity. Myself. The way I taught my students.",
  "mission_06/dial_07/03/kanindo": "No, this bastard won't get off that easy! Let him feel all the suffering of the people on his own skin!",
  "mission_06/dial_07/comment/vyuga": "I agree, show trials have an effect.",
  "mission_06/dial_07/comment/shilo": "That's right! Let him suffer, the asshole!",
  "mission_06/dial_07/comment/shaman": "You can't argue. The crowd loves blood.",
  "mission_06/dial_07/comment/grif": "I'm not a fan of medieval methods, but there is something attractive in the words of our Che Guevara.",
  "mission_06/dial_07/comment/simba": "Yeah, so that others don't get the idea!",
  "mission_06/dial_08/01/julia": "Commander... I think it's wrong to mock people, even very bad ones. You can't respond to cruelty with cruelty.",
  "mission_06/dial_08/02/julia": "Yes, at some point it seemed to me that I hated the Teacher with all my soul. But now, looking at him, I feel only bitterness... and pity.",
  "mission_06/dial_08/03/julia": "Please let him do what he wants. That will be enough.",
  "mission_06/dial_08/comment/disel": "And if he chickens out, I'll shoot him myself - and that's the end of it.",
  "mission_06/dial_08/comment/debut": "I agree with Yulia Leonidovna. It will be more humane.",
  "mission_06/dial_08/comment/chapay": "That's right. We can't allow lynching, otherwise these partisans will get completely out of hand!",
  "mission_06/dial_08/comment/umka": "Oh, it's better this way than to arrange a Gestapo.",

  "news/random/1/harvard/text": "A new ranking of the most prestigious universities in the world has been published. The top three include the National University of Singapore, Peking University and Tsinghua University. The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology is in fourth place this year, pushing aside the University of Tokyo, which fell to fifth place in the ranking.<br><br> For the first time, neither Harvard nor Yale made it into the rankings. The last place in the top ten was clung to by MIT, the only non-Asian institution that can still compete with the new leaders in education. Harvard's president said the rankings were biased and that the distribution of places was due to a \"short-lived fad for all things Asian,\" and that a truly academic education was still only worth getting at the Ivy League.",

  "news/random/1/neighbours/text": "The city of K. was taken without a fight: Mayor Samuel Ambani himself handed the city over to Daamat. Ambani officially entered Daamat, his sons went to fight, and a people's militia was created in the city.<br><br> According to the mayor, the police regularly caught Popular Front rebels in the jungle. They were sent to a mine controlled by Daamat \"for re-education.\" They were sent for money that went to support the militias. The fact that slave trade was actually being conducted under the guise of re-education did not bother Daamat's commanders. They were bothered by something else.<br><br> Six months later, it turned out that the police had never caught any rebels. Ambani had passed off his neighbors as them, with whom he was deliberately settling scores. All those whom Ambani sold into slavery belonged to another ethnic group and historically owned the land on which the mayor's family had worked as farm laborers in the past. The age-old hatred had finally found an outlet…<br><br> Field commander Daamat decreed: \"Africa must be united\" - and gave the order to shoot Samuel Ambani.

Sefu Kanindo served as president for 3 years and 8 months. During this time, he nationalized 6 mining companies and 14 heavy and light industry enterprises, 9 of which soon ceased operations. Their total share in the country's production was 54%. The brave general also set the state exchange rate and fixed prices for 79 essential goods. The construction of a hydroelectric power station and an agricultural machinery plant was initiated - a total of more than 2.6 billion dollars were spent on them, but the work did not progress beyond the project (which, by the way, no one saw).<br><br> By the end of his reign, the annual inflation rate was 763%. 74% of the population lived below the poverty line. Unemployment reached 35%. Foreign companies withdrew more than 50% of their total investments from the country… Some experts believe that the war with Daamat literally saved Kanindo’s reputation and political career, which otherwise would have ended in impeachment, if not a military coup.<br><br> Recently, Sefu Kanindo, already as a general of the Popular Front, made a statement that after his movement's victory over Daamat, Africa will experience peace and prosperity.

  "chat/chuma_debut/dial_01/07/debut": "Basically, that's it. You just rearrange the pieces. Let's play sometime?",

  "chat/chuma_chapay/dial_01/01/chuma": "Uncle Chapai, Uncle Chapai... The heat is getting on my nerves, I can't stand it! Talk to the commander, will you? Let him at least let us go for a swim after the mission, there's a river nearby...",

  "chat/chuma_chapay/dial_01/06/chapay": "They are the ones! First you throw a grenade into the river, only then you climb in. And two groups should go: some splashing around, others on the shore, with weapons at the ready. Got it?",

  "chat/chapay_shaman/dial_01/03/chapay": "Well, well, well. Taking down guards, I understand... But you don't cut people every day. Why do you sharpen your knife every single evening?",
  "chat/chapay_shaman/dial_01/04/shaman": "Obliged. To maintain weapons in constant readiness for use. According to the regulations.",
  "chat/chapay_shaman/dial_01/05/chapay": "Ah, so you love the charter! Well, that's a good thing...",
  "chat/chapay_shaman/dial_01/06/chapay": "I see that you love so much that your face even changes when you sharpen your knife according to regulations. It becomes so dreamy…",

  "chat/chuma_shaman/dial_01/08/shaman": "I don't take risks. I feel how it will be. Where someone breathes. Who is the hunter, who is the victim. I leave some, I remove others.",
  "chat/chuma_shaman/dial_01/09/shaman": "I shoot for sure. No need to torture. You give them an easy death, they give you one. Too bad it's inconvenient here with a knife. I could have cut it. It's more honest. Did you explain?",
