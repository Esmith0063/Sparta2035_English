Hey all!


So after several hours I went through and translated the vast majority of this game into English! as Many of us know, the version you can buy on the store is RU only; and although the Devs are working on a full English release I wanted to play it NOW. So I used some game and app developer tools and put the localization through an API that preserved the game code but isolated the language and text that was all in Russian. I then translated all 6350 lines of code to English very roughly, and finally I have been playing through it to make changes and find translation tweaks so it makes more sense to English speakers. Its not 100% perfect, but im slowly changing and adjusting a few things but its completely playable and as someone who is from the US and doesn't understand Russian I had no problem playing.

I have officially gotten permission from the Devs to share this with everyone here! There will be periodic updates and ill notify everyone on here when they happen.


HOW TO INSTALL

1) download this file

2) go to your Sparta 2035 game in your steam library and right click and click on browse local files.

3) go to Sparta_Data/Streamingassests/Localizations and there will be two files. English and Russian

4) MAKE A COPY of the file labeled "Russian" in there and save it somewhere on your PC as a back up

5) Drag and drop the file you downloaded from the link into the localizations folder and replace the file labeled "Russian". Make sure it is spelled exactly as the copy you made.

6)It will ask if you want to overwrite. Say yes. and now you can start the game up!

BE AWARE!

This is an unofficial translation made by me for fun. This isnt a professional project and i get nothing from this. I will update and change it as time goes until the Official translation comes. This WILL change your game files so if you update or verify files or uninstall and reinstall you will very likely need to redo these steps. This is a rough work around until the Devs release the update.


FAQ


If you have questions or suggestions leave them here but as this is not my full time job and just a hobby I may not reply or respond for awhile. I may not change every little detail or translation because again this goes away once the official translation comes out.

A) Its not working.....

Make sure you follow the steps above and download the latest file from the link and it matches exactly how the file is spelled in your folder. Make sure you replace the Russian file and not the English labeled. This is because the game launches only reading the file labeled Russian, so we are tricking the game into reading our translation.






I have full permission from the lead developer to release this and if they decide at any time to remove those permissions or ask me to pull the file I will do so and no other re-upload will be allowed in the event I take this down. Feel free to make your own edits but just be respectful please :) Thanks!


With Kind Regards,
